# Drone_Gesture_Recognition
In this Drone Gesture Recognition model, I've used the MediaPipe framework to implement a gesture recognition model which outputs movements for the drone to follow when it detects certain gesture. 

The gestures being recognised are the default 7 gestures available in Mediapipe.
Open_Palm - Takeoff
Closed_Fist - Land 
Pointing_Up - Move Forward
Thumb_Down - Move Backwards
Thumb_Up - Move Up
Victory - Clockwise Rotate
ILoveYou - Counter Clockwise Rotate
